## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- At first, the design wasnâ€™t as visually cohesive as I wanted it to be so revise the color scheme and styles to create a more polished and consistent look throughout the app.
- Implementing the search bar was a bit tricky. I had to make sure that users could search for games with lowercase not the exact name.
